		<h3>Minerals are big here!</h3>
		<p class="text-alignment">
		Picture a mass of hot molten magma spreading below the Earth’s surface. As it cools slowly into solid rock, steam concentrates into trapped pockets that cool slowly over millennia. Geologists know these pockets are where to find amazing minerals such as tourmaline, topaz, and beryl, as well as common ones like quartz, and mica.
